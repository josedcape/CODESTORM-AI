I'll help you fix the syntax error in your code. The issue is in the process_request function around line 871. There's an incomplete if statement that contains an invalid regular expression pattern.

Let's examine the problematic section:

@app.route('/api/process', methods=['POST']) def process_request(): """API para procesar solicitudes genéricas.""" try: data = request.json if not([a-zA-Z0-9]+)?\s*', r'\1\n', response)


The error is that you have an incomplete `if` statement with a regular expression that appears to be part of a string replacement operation, but it's not properly formatted as a Python statement.

Here's how to fix it:

I apologize for the error. Let me analyze the code properly without trying to execute it.

The issue in your code is at line 871 where there's an incomplete `if` statement followed by what appears to be a regular expression replacement. This is causing a syntax error because the `if` statement isn't properly formed.

Here's how to fix the `process_request` function:

@app.route('/api/process', methods=['POST'])
def process_request():
    """API para procesar solicitudes genéricas."""
    try:
        data = request.json
        if not data:
            return jsonify({
                'success': False,
                'error': 'No se proporcionaron datos'
            }), 400

        # Process the request data here
        # ...

        # If you were trying to format code blocks in a response:
        # response = re.sub(r'```([a-zA-Z0-9]+)?\s*', r'```\1\n', response)

        return jsonify({'success': True, 'response': 'Processed successfully'})
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in process_request: {str(e)}")
        return jsonify({
            'success': False,
            'error': str(e)
        }), 500

The problem was that you had an incomplete `if` statement that was immediately followed by what looks like a regular expression replacement operation. The `if` statement needs a condition and a code block, and the regular expression operation should be a complete statement.
